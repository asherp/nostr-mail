## Nostr-mail

A simple email encryption tool based on secp256 key pairs.

How it works:

Nostr-mail encrypts content using a symetric key derived from a combination of the sender's private key and the receiver's public key.

Both sender and receiver derive a shared secret known only to them, which is used to protect their communications.

This application can use any email server for delivery.
