# CFG Grammar Definition for BIP39 Encode Body
# Format: NonTerminal = Production1 | Production2 | ...
# Terminal symbols are POS tags: Det, Adj, N, V, Modal, Aux, Cop, To, Prep, Adv, Dot
# Optional elements use ? suffix
# Parentheses group sequences
# Weight annotations: (weight: production) for probabilistic selection

# Main sentence structure - all sentences go through proper NP structure
# Weighted alternatives for natural sentence variety
S = (0.85: NP VP Dot) | (0.10: NP Adv V NP Dot) | (0.05: NP V NP Dot)

# NP: allow bare noun to avoid forced filler determiners/adjectives
NP = N | Det N | Det Adj N

# VP: base verb phrase, optionally followed by one-or-more prepositional phrases.
# This reads more naturally than making PP self-recursive, because “PP” stays a
# simple unit ("Prep NP") and VP handles chaining ("... in the house on the hill ...").
VP = (0.70: VP_BASE) | (0.30: VP_BASE VP_PP_TAIL)

# Base VP shapes (no PPs attached here)
# Added infinitive forms using To
VP_BASE = (0.30: Modal V NP) | (0.15: Cop Adj) | (0.10: V NP) | (0.02: Modal V) | (0.03: V To V) | (0.02: Modal V To V)

# One-or-more PPs, with a bias toward stopping after the first PP.
VP_PP_TAIL = (0.70: PP) | (0.30: PP VP_PP_TAIL)

PP = Prep NP
