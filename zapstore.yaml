name: nostr-mail
summary: A modern, cross-platform email encryption tool that bridges Nostr and email protocols
description: |
  Nostr-mail encrypts email content using a symmetric key derived from a combination of the sender's private key and the receiver's public key. Both sender and receiver derive a shared secret known only to them, which is used to protect their communications.
  
  This application can use any email server for delivery while leveraging Nostr's decentralized social key registry for key discovery and management.
  
  Features:
  - SMTP Email Sending and IMAP Email Fetching
  - End-to-end encryption using NIP-44 (default) and NIP-04
  - Nostr direct messages and contact management
  - Profile management with Nostr social key registry
  - Cross-platform support (Windows, macOS, Linux, Android)
